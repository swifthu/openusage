/// renders. See `docs/adding-a-provider.md` for the full walkthrough.
///
/// `refresh()` returns the latest snapshot. Build its `lines` from the app's small metric vocabulary,
/// choosing the case by the shape of the value:
/// - `.progress` — a bounded meter with a `used`/`limit` and a `format` (percent, dollars, or count). Use
///   for anything with a ceiling: session/weekly quotas, credits with a cap. Add `resetsAt` when the
///   window resets at a known time.
/// - `.values` — one or more typed, unbounded numbers. Use for spend, balances, token counts, and other
///   limitless numeric rows; formatting stays at the display edge.
/// - `.badge` — a short status pill (e.g. "Disabled", or a pay-as-you-go cap). Use for state, not a number
///   to fill a bar with.
/// - `.chart` — dated numeric points rendered as a compact usage trend.
/// - `.text` — a string-valued provider notice preserved for the local API. Dashboard widgets do not
///   parse display text; use a typed line above for every widget descriptor.
///
/// On failure, return `ProviderSnapshot.error(provider:error:)` with a typed provider error so the error
/// surfaces loudly in the UI and telemetry can report a stable, non-PII category. Use the message-only
/// factory only when no typed error exists.
