# Claude

Tracks your Claude subscription limits using the login you already have from Claude Code or Claude Desktop.

Each account and organization gets its own Claude card with separate limits and spending. Signing in to
the same account and organization through both Claude Code and Claude Desktop still creates only one card.

## What it tracks

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Session | 5-hour rolling window usage |
| Weekly | 7-day window usage |
| Fable | Separate weekly Fable limit (model-scoped window from the `limits` array) |
| Sonnet | Separate weekly Sonnet limit (plan-dependent) |
| Extra Usage | Extra-usage credits spent against your monthly cap |
| Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days | Local spend, as cost, tokens, or both (see below) |

Fable is enabled and always visible directly below Weekly by default. Sonnet stays off until you
enable it in Customize. When Claude reports your plan name, OpenUsage shows it beside the provider name.
The plan comes from Anthropic's live account profile, so an upgrade (say, Max 5x to Max 20x) shows up on
the next refresh without signing in to Claude Code again. If the profile can't be read, the badge falls
back to the plan saved with your login.

## Where credentials come from

Sign in with Claude Code or Claude Desktop; OpenUsage reads the existing login. It checks these sources, preferring one that can read your subscription usage:

1. The macOS keychain entry Claude Code maintains (its source of truth on macOS)
2. `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.credentials.json`)
3. Claude Desktop's encrypted login cache
4. `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` environment variable

When multiple accounts are available, a Claude Desktop login for the card's organization takes precedence
when needed. OpenUsage verifies that a credential belongs to the correct account and organization.

Claude Desktop support is read-only. OpenUsage decrypts its currently valid access token using the
`Claude Safe Storage` item in your macOS Keychain. It never reads or uses Desktop's refresh token, and
never changes Desktop's config, cookies, or Keychain entry. This prevents OpenUsage from invalidating
Claude Desktop's session.

Both older Desktop login caches and newer account-specific caches are supported. Account-specific
tokens must match the account currently signed in to Desktop and the card's organization. A newer
cache entry or deletion marker takes precedence over an older copy of the same login.

macOS asks once before OpenUsage can access that Keychain item. Background refreshes never open the
password dialog: OpenUsage first asks you to refresh manually, and choosing **Always Allow** makes later
refreshes silent. If Desktop's short-lived token expires, open Claude Desktop so it can renew the login,
then refresh OpenUsage.

A `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` — usually a long-lived `claude setup-token` — can run the model but can't read your Session and Weekly limits, and it often lingers in your shell environment. So when a real keychain or file login is present, OpenUsage uses that login for the live meters and keeps the environment token only as a fallback; the Session/Weekly meters no longer go blank just because that token is set. If the environment token is your *only* credential (a headless setup), it's used on its own and the spend tiles still load from local logs.

If one source holds an expired or "locked out" token, OpenUsage falls back to the others — so signing in again with `claude` outside the app is picked up on the next refresh, without restarting OpenUsage. Claude Code tokens are refreshed automatically; rotated tokens are written back only while the ordered login candidates still match the start of the refresh, so a newly added higher-priority login wins. Claude Desktop tokens are never refreshed or written by OpenUsage.

## Claude Swap accounts

OpenUsage discovers the saved accounts in Claude Swap's `~/.claude-swap-backup/sequence.json`
on launch. Each account gets a card labeled with its organization followed by its email. A login already found through Claude Code
or Desktop shares the same card when both the account and organization match. Restart OpenUsage after
adding or removing a saved account.

If the default login identifies an account but has no organization ID, it remains available as a
separate default card alongside saved Swap accounts. OpenUsage does not guess which saved
organization it belongs to. Its spending stays excluded while multiple accounts are known, until
the login identifies its organization.

Saved accounts use the active default login when it names that exact account, followed by their own
Claude Swap session profile's Keychain entry and credential file. They
never fall back to another account's default Claude login or an environment token. The saved vault is
a final, read-only fallback. OpenUsage does not rotate vault tokens or modify Claude Swap's account
list. If a vault login is stale, launch that account with `cswap run <email>`, then refresh OpenUsage.
Matching Desktop credentials remain available on the merged card, including when Swap was its
original source. If a preferred login expires or is rejected, the card tries its other matching
sources. Every live credential must identify the same account and organization before supplying limits.
Logins that can read live usage are tried before logins with limited permissions, so a default login
without `user:profile` does not hide working Session and Weekly limits from a matching saved session.
Session profile credentials can renew normally, with updates saved back to that same profile.

Local spending includes Claude Swap session histories as well as the default Claude history. Shared
history is deduplicated and filtered by its recorded account and organization; entries without account
ownership stay excluded when multiple accounts are known. Broader SDK and Conductor history
attribution is outside this change's scope; missing ownership is not inferred from the current login.

## The spend tiles

Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days are computed **locally**: OpenUsage reads the Claude Code session logs under `~/.claude/projects/` (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) itself — no external tools needed. Symlinks are followed, so a projects folder linked into a synced location (say, a Dropbox folder) is read all the same. With one known account, Claude usage from the [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) coding agent counts too: OpenUsage reads pi's session logs under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/` (or `$PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`) and folds any Claude usage there into the same tiles and trend, so a Claude sub driven through pi still shows up here. pi records its own per-message cost, so those dollars come straight from pi rather than being re-estimated. Cowork (the Claude desktop app's agent mode) counts too: it writes the same logs into per-session folders under `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/`, and OpenUsage scans those as well, so desktop agent sessions show up in the tiles alongside terminal ones. Persisted `claude -p` runs count as well. Runs made with `--no-session-persistence` cannot appear because Claude deliberately writes no session log for OpenUsage to read. Advisor work recorded inside a message is counted once under the advisor's own model; the parent's main-model totals are kept separate, and ordinary iteration details are not counted again. A log's recorded fast or standard speed controls its price; OpenUsage does not infer speed from the event date. Days are grouped in your Mac's local time zone, so they line up with your own calendar. Each period is one tile showing cost and tokens together (`$4.08 · 1.2M tokens`); a day with no usage reads **No data** rather than a misleading `$0.00 · 0 tokens` — the same as every other spend-tracking provider. The live Session and Weekly meters are unaffected. The dollars are estimated from token counts at API rates (that's the ⓘ) using the shared [model pricing](../pricing.md); the token counts themselves are measured. No log data leaves your Mac.

Sessions that do not identify their account, including usage from pi and third-party tools such as
Conductor, count as long as OpenUsage has never seen more than one Claude account. Once multiple
accounts are discovered, unattributed usage is left out instead of being assigned to the wrong card.

Subagent logs inherit their parent session's ownership, even when that parent is older than the
spend window. Sessions with conflicting account or organization records are excluded. OpenUsage
checks each parent once per refresh and reuses unchanged ownership results, including conflicts,
across refreshes. Failed reads are retried on the next refresh, and large ownership scans stop
when the refresh is cancelled.

Claude subagents, including agents nested inside workflows, inherit their parent session's account.
Their usage appears while they run and is included in the same spend tiles. Existing workflow logs
are picked up on the next refresh; there is no need to rerun the workflow or clear the usage cache.

Local spend does not require a Claude OAuth login. If Claude Code uses an API-key gateway instead, the spend tiles and usage trend still load from its session logs; the Claude header shows **Not logged in** because the live Session and Weekly meters still require a Claude subscription login.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Not logged in"** — run `claude` and sign in to enable live subscription limits, then refresh. If you use an API-key gateway, local spend still appears whenever Claude Code has written session logs.
- **"Claude Desktop login found"** — refresh manually and choose **Always Allow** when macOS asks for access to `Claude Safe Storage`.
- **"Claude Desktop login is stale"** — open Claude Desktop so it can renew the login, then refresh OpenUsage.
- **"Re-login for live usage"** (an amber warning on the Claude header) — your saved login can authenticate for inference but can't read your subscription limits, because it lacks the `user:profile` access (this is what an inference-only token from `claude setup-token` carries). Run `claude` and sign in again with your Claude account, then refresh; the spend tiles keep working in the meantime.
- **"Updates blocked by Anthropic"** (an amber warning on the Claude header) — the usage API is throttling OpenUsage. It keeps the last values from the same login, shows when it will retry, and backs off in the meantime. A different login starts with a fresh cache and cooldown.
- **Spend tiles show "No data"** — OpenUsage found no Claude Code logs in the last 30 days. If your logs live somewhere custom, set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` so both Claude Code and OpenUsage look in the same place.

## Under the hood

`GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` with the selected OAuth token. Claude Code tokens refresh via `platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token`; Claude Desktop tokens are read-only and must be renewed by Desktop itself. If a token is expired or revoked, OpenUsage retries with the next credential source before reporting an error.

The plan badge reads `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/profile` (the organization's `rate_limit_tier`), because the plan Claude Code saves at sign-in never updates afterwards. To stay clear of Anthropic's rate limits, that lookup runs at most once per access token — after a usage fetch has succeeded — and cards bound to a specific account reuse the profile they already fetched to verify identity, so they make no extra request. Inference-only tokens skip it entirely.

When the five-hour session window hasn't begun (the usage API reports no reset time), the Session row shows **Not started** on the trailing label; hover explains that the session begins after your first message. A reported reset time means the window is running, so the row always shows the countdown then — even when Anthropic's whole-percent numbers still read 0% because less than 1% has been used, which matches what Claude Code itself shows.
